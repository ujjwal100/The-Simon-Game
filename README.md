## About The Game
This project is a simulation of the famous Simon Game, in which an electronic device creates a series 
of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds,the series becomes 
progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is over.
